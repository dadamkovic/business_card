Project in Progress
----------------------------

A PCB for a simple, low profile business card. Intended to be
programmed with a few simple games. BOM cost as of version 0.1 is ~6$.

Includes: 
- 5 LEDs
- buzzer
- STM32F042F6Px (USB communication)

PCB has cutout for components that are inteded to be mounted 'body in'
to decrease the thickness of the PCB (1.2mm PCB used), to get close to
the business card compactness.
